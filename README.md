# FCC Web Development Certificate

# A repo for the projects I did back in August 2020

This repo consists of 4 of the 5 projects, the missing one -and my favorite one of the series- you can find at
https://github.com/fskarmeta/fcc-technical-documentation-page .

This was my first ever aproach to html and css.

I also added a excuse generator, not from this certificate series, but I didn't want to create a hole repo for it alone.
